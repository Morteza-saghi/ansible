By default, Ansible looks for the configuration file in the following locations, in order

1    ./ansible.cfg (in the current working directory)

2   ~/.ansible.cfg (in the user's home directory)


Ansible modules?

units of code that can be used to perform specific tasks or actions within an Ansible playbook or task

Each module is designed to handle a particular type of task


Ansible expects the configuration file to be named "ansible.cfg"
